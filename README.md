### Installation:
First download this archive file [dotfiles.tar](). Then unzip it, after unzipping it you'll get all the configuration file you need. After that place all the contents according to directories and make some changes according to your need. Then unzip the `cursor.tar.gz` file and use `lxappearance` and import the tar file and select the cursor theme pack.

I used `pywal` utility to generate the color scheme. you'll find a short tutorial on how to generate the same color scheme as me inside `.cache/wal`.
